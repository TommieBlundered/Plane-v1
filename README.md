# Plane-v1

This is my first plane I've ever designed, I choose these rules:

* High wing
* Straight wing, so not forward-swept or delta wings. Just normal straight wings.
* Big dihedral [7°]
* Rudder + elevator + motor
* CG target: 25–30% chord
* Only rudder and elevator, it will not have ailerons.
* **Goal:** stable glide, not performance

**Also some design notes I will set for myself:**
* Making sure the battery position is adjustable, so I can change the CG easily.
* Add a replaceable belly skid so I don't need to add wheels for my first prototype.
* I will print it with eSUN Light Weight PLA Filament and PLA+ from ELEGOO
* Infill will probably be Gyroid

**Extra Info:**
- Wingspan: ~900 mm
- Average chord: ~180 mm
- Wing area: ~0.14 m²
- CG: 25–30% chord
- Wing: straight; 7° dihedral
- Landing: belly skid only
- Prop: 9×4.5 (9045)
